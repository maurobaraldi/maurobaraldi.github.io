## Metrics to Track in DevOps
---
.left-column[
  ## Measuring What Matters
]
.right-column[
- Deployment Frequency: How often we successfully release to production

- Lead Time for Change: Time from code commit to production

- Change Failure Rate: % of releases causing incidents or rollbacks

- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):Time to restore service after failure

- Business Impact: Customer satisfaction, reliability, performance trends
]
---
.left-column[
  ## KPI Dashboard – Executive View
]
.right-column[
- Flow Metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, cycle time

- Stability Metrics: change failure rate, MTTR, incident trends

- Pipeline Health: build success rate, automated test coverage

- Reliability: availability %, SLA/SLO compliance, error rate

- Automation Level: % automated deployments and infrastructure as code

- Self-Service Adoption: environment provisioning usage across teams

- Customer Experience: latency, uptime, user feedback score
]
---
template: inverse

## Our DevOps initiative and roadmap
